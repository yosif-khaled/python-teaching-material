The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is supposed
to do and how you are making it work. When you are in the middle of
working on a project, you understand how all of the pieces fit together. But
when you return to a project after some time away, you will likely have forgotten
some of the details. You can always study your code for a while and figure
out how segments were supposed to work, but writing good comments
can save you time by summarizing your overall approach in clear English.
34 Chapter 2
If you want to become a professional programmer or collaborate with
other programmers, you should write meaningful comments. Today, most
software is written collaboratively, whether by a group of employees at one
company or a group of people working together on an open source project.
Skilled programmers expect to see comments in code, so it is best to start
adding descriptive comments to your programs now. Writing clear, concise
comments in your code is one of the most beneficial habits you can form as
a new programmer.
When you are determining whether to write a comment, ask yourself if
you had to consider several approaches before coming up with a reasonable
way to make something work; if so, write a comment about your solution.
It is much easier to delete extra comments later on than it is to go back
and write comments for a sparsely commented program.
